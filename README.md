# VisualOxide
A CLI image processor made in Rust that will be capable of processing images (color, size, crop, effects, etc) and encoding them.

The program is on a very early stage and as of now it doesn't do much.

# Compiling from source
VisualOxide will work on any operative system that supports Rust's compiler and package manager

Install cargo, Rust's package manager, and open a terminal in the project's directory and run ``` cargo build -r ```
